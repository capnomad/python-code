Okay, so now we know how to open a file. 
Now we have to learn how to read through the file, and it couldn't be easier, it really couldn't be easier. 
It's almost at the point where you probably would have guessed it if I didn't tell you. Well, so xfile. 
remember, is not the data, it's a way to get to the data. It's a sequence. 
Well, we already have a loop, the determinant loop, the for loop, and all you do is you put the handle here. 
Now this is not the same as putting a string there, the for loop is smart. 
This is some kind of a sequence of things. 
So a file handle to the for loop looks like a sequence of lines. 
It's a sequence of lines. So again, the for loop is going to run this code multiple times where the iteration variable, cheese in this case, 
is going to take on the successive lines. 
If this file has 10 lines, this loop is going to run 10 times. 
Cheese is going to be the first line, the second line, third line. 
So that's it, that's it. Isn't it pretty? No while loop, no end of file, no nothing. 
Run this as many times as necessary, one time through for each of the lines in the file. 
You take care all the stuff. And if you've done this in other programming languages, you'll be like, Python, you are my friend. 
Because it's simple. 
And you can look at it and go like, I know what it's doing. Whereas all the other programming languages have like total gibberish ways of doing this. 
And yes, you can figure it out and after you've used C or some other JavaScript language or whatever to read a file, Python is better. 
Because Python is elegant and straightforward, and it has to do with this for and in clause which I'm so in love with. 
So that just says treat a file handle as a sequence of lines, and allow us to iterate through it automatically using the for loop.
